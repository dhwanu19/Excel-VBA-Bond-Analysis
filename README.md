# Home Deposit Investment Strategy Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to assist Jackson, a recent actuarial graduate, in planning his investment strategy to save for a home deposit over the next 10 years. Utilizing an Excel-based model, we analyze various investment options, incorporating salary growth, bonus probabilities, and different investment returns, to project the potential savings accumulation by 2033.

## Features

- **Salary and Bonus Projections:** Detailed monthly projections of Jackson's income, including base salary increments, sign-on bonus, and performance-related bonuses.
- **Savings Calculation:** Monthly savings calculations based on a fixed percentage of Jackson's total income.
- **Investment Strategy Simulation:** Evaluation of three investment strategies using the Nelson-Siegel-Svensson formula for bond returns, historical data for stock returns (VAS), and market condition-dependent returns for a risky asset X.
- **Risk Analysis:** Assessment of the impact of market conditions and downside risks on the risky asset X.
- **Projection of Accumulated Savings:** Simulation of the future value of investments under different scenarios over a 10-year period.

## Structure

The Excel file, `Excel-VBA-Investment-Analysis.xlsx`, contains multiple sheets, each dedicated to specific aspects of the analysis:
- Income and Investment: Breakdown of monthly income and investment allocations.
- Investment Options: Detailed analysis of the three investment strategies.
- Risky Asset X: Simulation of returns for the risky asset under varying market conditions.
- Summary and Recommendations: Overview of findings and tailored advice for Jackson based on the analysis.
